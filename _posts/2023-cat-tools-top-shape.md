Recent advancements in <a href="https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/machine-translation">machine translation (MT)</a> software have emphasized the importance of translation tools for professional translators, especially for technical texts like medical and legal texts. However, these CAT tools -- such as translation memories and termbases -- requires contant maintenance and updates to ensure their effectiveness. Take a moment to learn more about translation memories and termbases, why they are essential to translators, and how to maintain them properly to help build your reputation as a translator.

What is a translation memory?
=====
A translation memory (TM) is a database that stores previously translated content in both the original (source) language and the translated (target) language. It is typically used within a <a href="https://www.memoq.com/tools/what-is-a-translation-management-system">translation management system (TMS)</a>, or the software that manages translation assets and workflows. When translating a text within a TMS, the translation memory automatically records your translations, segmenting them into sentences and paragraphs. This stored data can be accessed later as a reference when working on similar projects, making translation memories invaluable for speeding up the translation process and ensuring consistency across translated documents.

What is a termbase?
=====
While translation memories store previously translated content in both the source and target languages, a termbase – also known as a glossary – stores specialized, field-specific language. A termbase is a searchable database that contains multilingual terms and rules governing their usage. Translators and translation teams create termbases, and they should adhere to set of <a href="https://info.lionbridge.com/rs/lionbridge/images/Lionbridge FAQ_Glossary_2013.pdf">best practices</a>, such as including industry- or company-specific terms and providing context examples and definitions for each term.

How to make sure they work for your needs
=====
Understanding the key tools in a translator’s toolkit is crucial for building a strong set of translation resources. Equally important is the ongoing maintenance of these resources to ensure their continued efficacy. Here are a few suggestions for maintaining translation memories and termbases:

* Regularly review your TM. As you translate new projects in your TMS, your translation memory grows. However, this growth does not guarantee that the translations will remain error-free. Regularly review your translation memory to identify and correct common mistakes and ensure that the recommended translations are of high quality.
* Understand the different types of matches. When working on a new translation, your TM will display previous translations with a percentage score indicating how closely they match the new text. Compared the saved translations with the context of your new project to ensure accuracy.
* Define “term” for yourself and your team. The <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/translation/en/terminology/what-we-do">European Parliament’s Translation Service</a> defines terms as “[specialized] words and expressions specific to a particular subject field”. It is your responsibility as a translator or member of a translation team to determine which specialized words and expressions should be added to the termbase based on your needs and subject field. Consider including “do not translate” terms that should remain unchanged during translation.
* Enhance your termbase with additional documentation. To provide further guidance and clarification to translators, supplement your termbase with dictionary definitions, parts of speech, images, and examples that demonstrate the term’s usage in context for each language.
* Consider the context. While termbases are invaluable tools for quickly translating specialized language accurately, it is crucial to consider the context and purpose of a text before automatically including a term in your translation. Consult reliable resources or references to ensure accurate and contextually-appropriate translations.

Regularly reviewing and updating your translation memory and termbase helps enhance the quality and efficiency of your translations, ensure consistency, and build a solid reputation in the industry.
