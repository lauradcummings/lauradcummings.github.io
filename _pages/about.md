Hello! My name is Laura, and I am a data analyst with a passion for language and technology. I was born in the United States and lived in Madrid, Spain for eight years during my childhood before returning to Chicago, IL. I earned my BS in Psychology and Spanish, an MA in Spanish Linguistics, and a PhD in Spanish Linguistics from the University of Illinois (UIUC). 

I have been working professionally as a data analyst with a focus on terminology management for the past three years. I have an extensive background in data analysis and language research, and I have worked on data-based quality reviews in the following categories:

* Data analysis and visualization
* Terminology management
* English <-> Spanish translation and localization
* Search engine optimization (SEO)

Outside of work, I love taking fitness classes, cooking, and reading. I am also an avid traveler and have visited eleven countries. I recently started jogging and plan on running a 10K within the next year.
