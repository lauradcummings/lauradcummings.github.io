Hello! My name is Laura, and I am a data analyst with a passion for language and technology. I have an extensive background in data analysis, data visualization, and language research, and I have led data-based quality reviews of terminology management tools and analyzed consumer behavior to optimize websites based on SEO trends. 

I was born in the United States and lived in Madrid, Spain for eight years during my childhood before returning to Chicago, IL. I earned my BS in Psychology and Spanish, an MA in Spanish Linguistics, and a PhD in Spanish Linguistics from the University of Illinois (UIUC), as well as a certificate in Translation Studies.

Outside of work, I love taking fitness classes, cooking, and reading. I am also an avid traveler and have visited eleven countries. I recently started jogging and plan on running a 10K within the next year.
